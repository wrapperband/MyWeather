# MyWeather
### Using an Artificial Intellegence R-NN framework to predict local weather, an A.I. barometer 
 
MyWeather is a proposed A.I. framework trained on the weather temperature history, time and geographic locations to data fuse missing weather data.  
 
A deployable version of the (R-NN) framework will take sensor data  from some key positions, sunny, shady, windy and from those predict the local weather by adjusting to local conditions and sampling conditions.  
 
The A.I framework additional field training could be used to clean up (asses reliability) of bad (historical and current)  data to give a live prediction of global temperature and other weather data.  
 
These predictions, both local and global could be fed back to national weather prediction (for use or comparison) - maximizing its input coverage and automatically assesing and reducing and  bad data.
